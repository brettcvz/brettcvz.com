        <h1>We can give people superpowers.</h1>
        <p class="motto">Great products can take someone totally beyond what they thought they could do, which is why creating them is so much fun.</p>
        <p>
        Growing up, I dreamed of becoming a "door-to-door inventor" &mdash; I imagined talking to people about the problems they had and then designing devices to solve them. I never quite shook that dream, and am fortunate that my journey so far as a software engineer, startup founder, and product manager has let me do this at scale.
        </p>
        <p>
        Outside of work, I cook, dance, perform theater, hack on a number of side projects, and play piano. I currently live in San Francisco.
