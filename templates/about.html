        <p class="motto"> My goal is to help people become more thoughtful, happy, and complete versions of themselves.</p>
        <p>
        I love creating mission-driven teams where diverse, talented people can excel individually and work together to change industries. I enjoy encouraging my peers and direct reports to stretch into new challenges and realize how talented they are. And I thrive working in education, where I can dedicate my career to helping children realize their full potential.
        </p>
        <p>
        Outside of work, I cook, surf, hack on a number of side projects, and play soccer and guitar. I currently live in Oakland.
